This app is a weather application that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a specific location. It provides real-time weather data such as temperature, weather description, weather icon, temperature range, feels like temperature, pressure, and other related information.

The main features of the app include:

Current Weather Display: The app displays the current weather conditions for the searched location. It shows the location name, temperature in Celsius, weather description, weather icon, temperature range, feels like temperature, pressure, and the last updated time.

Recent Searches: The app keeps track of the user's recent weather searches. It displays the recently searched locations in a grid layout. Each search result shows the location name, weather icon, and temperature. Tapping on a recent search item opens a detailed view of the weather information for that location.

Search Functionality: Users can search for weather information by entering a specific location in the search field. Once a location is entered and submitted, the app fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the screen.

Error Handling: The app handles errors gracefully. If there is an error in fetching the weather data or if the entered location is invalid, it displays an appropriate error message to the user.

Clear Recent Searches: Users have the option to clear their recent search history with a single tap. This feature allows them to remove all previously searched locations from the recent searches section.

Overall, this weather app provides a user-friendly interface for quickly checking the weather conditions of different locations. It helps users plan their activities and make informed decisions based on real-time weather information.
